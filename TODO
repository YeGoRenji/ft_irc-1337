Bugs:
- Magically fixed: When two users on the same channel, one changes nickname, that nickname isn't freed (nickname is already in use)
- FIXED BY IGNORING SIGPIPE: CTRL+C while using nc (./clientJumia.sh) makes the server exit

TODOs:
- if we don't send a "\r\n" at the end of the command (e.g using nc) server kaybda yt9a7bn
- send all channel messages on client join (We wont do this I guess ?)
- check if TOPIC responses are flipped ? (TOPIC #ch :topic && TOPIC #ch)
- limiting message length ?
