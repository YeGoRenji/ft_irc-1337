- if we don't send a "\r\n" at the end of the command (e.g using nc) server kaybda yt9a7bn
- getIp() is still hardcoded to "localhost", implement a decent one already
- complete PRIVMSG to a channel
- test l errors dial PRIVMSG to a user using nc
- refractor getCommandTokens in handlePrivMsg and in the part function
- make a custom reply for PRIVMSG between users (dms)
